The Terra-RootParticipantEntity folder contains the pipeline that is specifically useful for working with non-demultiplexed data. The demultiplexed output map can then take two different routes: run on the participant-based counting pipeline (though results will also be stored in a map) or use the helper tool to convert the demultiplexed outputs into different samples then run on the sample-based counting pipeline. The latter is preferred, since succeeded and failed samples can easily be distinguished, and only the failed samples could be reran.
